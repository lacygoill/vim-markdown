PUNCTUATION                                               *markdown-punctuation*
==============================================================================

“fanboys” is a mnemonic tool to remember the list of coordinating conjunction:

 - for
 - and
 - nor
 - but
 - or
 - yet
 - so

When two independent clauses, in a  compound sentence, are joined with a fanboy,
the latter should be preceded by a comma:
>
    She wanted to study, but she was so tired.
                       ^

If the subject is not at the  beginning of the sentence, a comma should separate
the introductory  words (which  could be a  clause, a phrase,  or just  a single
word) from the subject:
>
    Before returning to work, I made sure to check my email.
                            ^

If you list more than 3 words or phrases  in a row, and the last two of them are
separated by “and”, put a comma even before “and”:
>
    My favorite foods are cookies, potatoes, and bread.
                                       ^

Coordinate adjectives are  two or more adjectives  coming in a row,  in front of
the same noun, all modifying the latter; they should be separated by commas:
>
    Wanda is a kind, beautiful woman.
                   ^


Don't put a  comma between two consecutive adjectives, if  the first one doesn't
modify the noun, but the second adjective: >

    I built a red brick wall.
                 ^
Here, you shouldn't put a comma  between the adjectives, because “red” qualifies
“brick”, not “wall”; “red” specifies the kind  of brick, and “brick” the kind of
wall.
In case of a doubt, try to add “and” between the two adjectives; if the sentence
doesn't make sense, don't add a comma.


If a sentence contains extra information, which is not necessary for the sentence
to maintain its meaning, this extra information should be surrounded by commas:
>
    Maria, who studied hard, will pass.
         ^                 ^
    Shelley, my neighbor, is nice.
           ^            ^
    All students who study hard will pass.
                ^              ^

In the last example, you can't surround the clause “who study hard” with commas,
because without it, the meaning of the sentence changes.


An interruptor is a word which interrupts the flow in a sentence.
An interruptor should be surrounded by commas:
>
    It is necessary, however, to study.
                   ^        ^


If you're speaking  to a person directly,  using their name, the  latter must be
separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma:
>
    Please pass me that book, Sam.
