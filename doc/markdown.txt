PUNCTUATION                                               *markdown-punctuation*
==============================================================================


< comma >_____________________________________________________________________~
                                                                *markdown-comma*

“fanboys” is a mnemonic tool to remember the list of coordinating conjunction:

 - for
 - and
 - nor
 - but
 - or
 - yet
 - so

When two independent clauses, in a  compound sentence, are joined with a fanboy,
the latter should be preceded by a comma:
>
    She wanted to study, but she was so tired.
                       ^

If the subject is not at the  beginning of the sentence, a comma should separate
the introductory  words (which  could be a  clause, a phrase,  or just  a single
word) from the subject:
>
    Before returning to work, I made sure to check my email.
                            ^

If you list more than 3 words or phrases  in a row, and the last two of them are
separated by “and”, put a comma even before “and”:
>
    My favorite foods are cookies, potatoes, and bread.
                                           ^

Coordinate adjectives are  two or more adjectives  coming in a row,  in front of
the same noun, all modifying the latter; they should be separated by commas:
>
    Wanda is a kind, beautiful woman.
                   ^


Don't put a  comma between two consecutive adjectives, if  the first one doesn't
modify the noun, but the second adjective: >

    I built a red brick wall.
                 ^
Here, you shouldn't put a comma  between the adjectives, because “red” qualifies
“brick”, not “wall”; “red” specifies the kind  of brick, and “brick” the kind of
wall.
In case of a doubt, try to add “and” between the two adjectives; if the sentence
doesn't make sense, don't add a comma.


If a sentence contains extra information, which is not necessary for the sentence
to maintain its meaning, this extra information should be surrounded by commas:
>
    Maria, who studied hard, will pass.
         ^                 ^

    Shelley, my neighbor, is nice.
           ^            ^

    All students who study hard will pass.
                ^              ^

In the last example, you can't surround the clause “who study hard” with commas,
because without it, the meaning of the sentence changes.


An interruptor is a word which interrupts the flow in a sentence.
An interruptor should be surrounded by commas:
>
    It is necessary, however, to study.
                   ^        ^


If you're speaking  to a person directly,  using their name, the  latter must be
separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma:
>
    Please pass me that book, Sam.
                            ^

In a date, the day of the week and the day of the month must be followed by a comma:
>
    My birthday is on Tuesday, June 22, 1980
                             ^        ^

In an address, the address must be  separated from the rest of the sentence, and
the city from the state:
>
    She lives at 123 HappyLane, in Houston, Texas.
                              ^           ^
<

< semicolon >_________________________________________________________________~
                                                            *markdown-semicolon*

A clause is a complete sentence, with a subject and a word.
Two  independent clauses  can be  joined together  with a  semicolon, to  form a
compound sentence:
>
    The cow is brown; it is also old.
                    ^

    He is very friendly; he always says "hello".
                       ^

    Some people write with a word processor; others write with a pen or pencil.
                                           ^

Use  a  semicolon  between  two   independent  clauses  that  are  connected  by
conjunctive adverbs or transitional phrases:
>
    I like cows; however, I hate the way they smell. 
               ^

    However  they  choose  to  write,  people are  allowed  to  make  their  own
    decisions; as a result, many people swear by their writing methods.
             ^

Use a semicolon (as a “super-comma”) between items in a list or series if any of
the items contain commas:
>
    She has lived in Walnut, California; Spokane, Washington; and Portland, Oregon.
                                       ^                    ^

    There  are basically  two ways  to write:  with a  pen or  pencil, which  is
    inexpensive and easily accessible; or by computer and printer, which is more
    expensive but quick and neat.    ^

                                                      v
    I like cows: they give us milk,  which tastes good; they give us beef, which
    also tastes  good; and  they give us  leather, which is  used for  shoes and
    coats.           ^


Use a semicolon between independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction
if the clauses are already punctuated with commas or if the clauses are lengthy:
>
                                                                           v
    Some people  write with  a word processor,  tablet, or a  even a  phone; but
    others, for different reasons, choose to write with a pen or pencil.
